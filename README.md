# GKD350_pcsx4all
Forked from soarqin/RG350_pcsx4all

Thanks for soraqin's code, because we often get your open source code to modify and compile to support gkd350, 
which leads to crazy revenge of some people with ulterior motives. I feel very depressed and chagrined about this. 
This is a DIY behavior spontaneous out of the love of the players. It's not a plagiarism of technology.
Technology has no boundary,! Nevertheless, we can't hide soraqin's great contribution to PS simulator. 
You let it support useful functions such as Chinese language. Thank you again. 
I hope you don't forget your original intention 
and continue to contribute selflessly to open source circle from the perspective of technology!!!
